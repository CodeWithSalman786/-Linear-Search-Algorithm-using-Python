# Linear Search Algorithm using Python

Welcome to the Pythonic Pursuit of Linear Search!

## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the linear search algorithm. Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that searches for a target value within a list by sequentially checking each element until a match is found or the entire list has been traversed.

## Key Features
- Efficient and easy-to-understand Python implementation.
- Suitable for small to medium-sized lists.
- Versatile algorithm applicable in various scenarios.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
3. Run the script and input the target value to search within the list.
